# Building Audio Apps with Rust
## An Overview of Tools and Techniques

Are you considering Rust for your next audio project? Join this talk to explore the current landscape of Rust’s audio ecosystem and determine if it's the right fit for your needs. We'll cover the essential tools and libraries for building desktop applications and audio plugins, helping you evaluate the maturity of Rust for your specific use case.

The session begins with an overview of how to access system audio across all major platforms—an essential foundation for any standalone audio application. Next, we’ll dive into integrating Digital Signal Processing (DSP) within the audio callback, focusing on writing real-time safe code and managing parameters in a thread-safe manner.

But an audio application is not complete without a user interface. We’ll explore the various strategies for creating GUIs in Rust, ranging from high-performance system UIs to sophisticated web-based interfaces.

By the end of this talk, you'll have the insights and tools necessary to build efficient, real-time audio applications in Rust. You’ll also gain a balanced understanding of the advantages and challenges of adopting Rust for audio development today.
